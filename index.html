    <h4>Day 1</h4>
    <p>
        Hello World! It's the first day of a new year where I'm supposed to be doing
        great things and honestly I don't know if I can stick to it every single day.
        But gosh heckin' darn I'm gonna try! <br>
        Let's start with the command line. To open on Linux press: Ctrl + Alt + T <br>
        Useful commands: cd~, cd "destination", l, touch "filename", code "filename" <br>
        I'm so tired and my attention span is waning. This is all I have for now, but
        we can always expand on the topic later. First drafts are sloppy and don't make 
        complete sense but we have the ideas down on the page. That's a great first day 
        in my book!
