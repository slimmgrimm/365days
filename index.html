    <h4>Day 1</h4>
    <p>
        Hello World! It's the first day of a new year where I'm supposed to be doing
        great things and honestly I don't know if I can stick to it every single day.
        But gosh heckin' darn I'm gonna try! <br>
        Let's start with the command line. To open on Linux press: Ctrl + Alt + T <br>
        Useful commands: cd~, cd "destination", l, touch "filename", code "filename" <br>
        I'm so tired and my attention span is waning. This is all I have for now, but
        we can always expand on the topic later. First drafts are sloppy and don't make 
        complete sense but we have the ideas down on the page. That's a great first day 
        in my book!
    </p>
    <h4>Day 2 & 3</h4>
    <p>
        I skipped Day 2 and the guilt is killing me! It's now 11pm of Day 3 and I'm desperately
        distracting myself from the pain that is my procrastination. Shall I give up in despair? 
        I say nay! There's a reason I'm calling this blog 365 Days of Dev and not 365 Days of Coding.
        I want it to be okay to talk about anything development related.<br><br>
        <strong><em>Comments are code.</em></strong><br>
        Comments explain code to other programmers including future me.
        Code explains the comments to the computer. <br><br>
        I like this concept! The idea is that when tackling a problem I first type my english 
        algorithm into VScode as comments. Separate each step of the algorithm into a new comment. 
        Type code underneath each algorithm step until you've solved each little problem. Eventually
        all the small solutions add up to a fully functioning program!
    </p>
    <h4>Day 4</h4>
    <p>
        Dark Souls repetition. I wrote these 3 words on a whiteboard next to my computer. Dark Souls is a brutal game that is infamous for killing the player over and over and over again unrelentingly. Only a true masochist would endure through the pain to reach the end. I've heard the same said about programmers. So in that light I want to get in the habit of repeating the same moves again and again and again until they're second nature. Today we have an exercise in creating github repos, cloning them to your local computer, and pushing changes to the repository. To start off we'll open the command line and designate a spot for all of our saved files to be stored. These are the commands in Linux:<br>
        Ctrl+Alt+t <em>opens the command line terminal</em><br>
        l <em>lists the contents of current directory</em><br>
        mkdir repos/ <em>creates a new folder to save our repository clones</em><br>
        cd repos/ <em>changes directory to repos AKA opens repos/ folder</em><br><br>
        create new github repository slimmgrimm/rockpaper (always add a README)<br>
        settings>branches>Default branch = dev<br>
        code dropdown>copy SSH key<br><br>
        rockpaper/ git clone ctrl+shift+v<br>
        l for list (empty folder)<br>
        code index.html<br>
        ! + enter to autogenerate HTML boilerplate<br>
        ctrl + s, ctrl + q<br>
        l for list (index.html, README.md)<br>
        git status (Untracked files:)<br>
        git add .<br>
        git status (Changes to be committed:)<br>
        git commit (vscode opens comment editor)<br>
        ctrl + s, ctrl + q<br>
        git status (Your branch is ahead of 'origin/dev' by 1 commit.)<br>
        git push<br>
        git status (Your branch is up to date with 'origin/dev')<br><br>
        Wait for Github to publish your changes. Usually takes less than 10 minutes. Tada! You're an accomplished publisher! Now it's time to make daily pushes and become a habitual contributor. PUSH IT REAL GOOD!

        Bonus Tip: VScode has a word wrap feature for writing walls of text like in this blog. Simply hit Alt + Z to wrap within the VScode window.
