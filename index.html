    <h4>Day 1</h4>
    <p>
        Hello World! It's the first day of a new year where I'm supposed to be doing
        great things and honestly I don't know if I can stick to it every single day.
        But gosh heckin' darn I'm gonna try! <br>
        Let's start with the command line. To open on Linux press: Ctrl + Alt + T <br>
        Useful commands: cd~, cd "destination", l, touch "filename", code "filename" <br>
        I'm so tired and my attention span is waning. This is all I have for now, but
        we can always expand on the topic later. First drafts are sloppy and don't make 
        complete sense but we have the ideas down on the page. That's a great first day 
        in my book!
    </p>
    <h4>Day 2 & 3</h4>
    <p>
        I skipped Day 2 and the guilt is killing me! It's now 11pm of Day 3 and I'm desperately
        distracting myself from the pain that is my procrastination. Shall I give up in despair? 
        I say nay! There's a reason I'm calling this blog 365 Days of Dev and not 365 Days of Coding.
        I want it to be okay to talk about anything development related.<br><br>
        <em>Comments are code.</em><br>
        Comments explain code to other programmers including future me.
        Code explains the comments to the computer. <br><br>
        I like this concept! The idea is that when tackling a problem I first type my english 
        algorithm into VScode as comments. Separate each step of the algorithm into a new comment. 
        Type code underneath each algorithm step until you've solved each little problem. Eventually
        all the small solutions add up to a fully functioning program!
